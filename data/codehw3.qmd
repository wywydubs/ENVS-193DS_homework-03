# Problem 1 

## A. Data Summarizing

I could compare the average time it took to get out of bed comparing alarm used
versus not used. I would want to know if getting out of bed after a natural 
wake up could be different on average than from an alarm, as there are different
factors like morning obligations hence an alarm versus less grogginess from 
waking up naturally. This comparison could be done by finding the mean of days
with alarm use and the mean of no alarm use, and it could inform me more about
the impact of alarms on my morning routine.
